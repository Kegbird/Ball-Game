# Ball Game
Ball Game is a very simple game where you have to bring a ball to the end of a path.

# Controls

- W: Jump
- A, D: Move left/right

# Map generation

The script MapGenerator generates a different level at each simulation. 

The level's structure is built based on an animation curve, which can be viewed in the inspector; the curve is 
created procedurally in the RandomizeMapCurve function.
