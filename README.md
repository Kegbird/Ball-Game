# Ball Game
Ball Game is a very simple game where you have to control a ball.

# Controls

- W: Jump
- A, D: Move left/right

# Map generation

The script, MapGenerator, generates a different level at each simulation. 

The path's structure is built based on an animation curve, which can be viewed in the inspector; the curve is 
created procedurally in the RandomizeMapCurve function.
